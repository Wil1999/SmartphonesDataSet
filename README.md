## Tidy Data 
In this section we will present a small introduction to what is the ordinance of our data, although we cannot explain briefly how it works in detail, the script will be attached for public view.

The script is simple and easy to understand, in any case it presents its own description in each pass it makes, but in this case we will talk about how it works in a general way.

We start first by assigning each variable a certain name for each data set, as in the documentation of the data it is presented, there are data on the X axis and Y axis, which somewhat logically encourages us to think that on the X axis They are the measurements for having greater weight and the Y axis is part of the name of each activity that was carried out in the data collection.

I define that, we will assign each label name with each activity with respect to the numbers indicated on the Y axis.
Once passed through here, the data sets are joined and presented together adding an identifier for each measurement.

The data with which I work was extracted from here.
